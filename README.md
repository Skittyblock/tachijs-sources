# tachijs-sources

Tachiyomi sources compiled to JavaScript for [Aidoku](https://github.com/Aidoku/Aidoku).

This is a heavy work in progress and is currently only a proof-of-concept. In order to support more sources, the [tachijs](https://github.com/Skittyblock/tachijs/) library needs to be expanded to support more of the Tachiyomi source dependencies.

Original sources can be found [here](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/), all credit goes to original authors.
